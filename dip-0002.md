# DIP-0002: Ad Offer Metadata Schema

## Abstract

The **d>sponsor** framework employs smart contracts for the management of ad offers. However, these contracts do not inherently store metadata, such as information about the offeror or details regarding the sponsorship—including its description and rules. Addressing this gap, the proposal outlines a method for associating ad offers with their respective metadata.

## Metadata Storing Strategy

To effectively link ad offer metadata with **d>sponsor** smart contracts, the following strategy is proposed:

1. **Metadata Storage**: Metadata should be organized in a JSON format and stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), ensuring decentralization and availability.
2. **Metadata Linkage**: When creating an ad offer through the **d>sponsor** offer creation smart contract, the IPFS link containing the metadata should be submitted as the `offerMetadata` argument.
3. **Metadata Accessibility**: A subgraph or any smart contract gateway is tasked with fetching and parsing the JSON metadata from the IPFS link, as denoted by the `offerMetadata` argument provided by the `UpdateOffer` event. Creators metadata should be updated and linked to an  `address`.

## Schema Definition

Below is the proposed schema for the ad offer metadata, detailing the keys and their descriptions. This schema is designed to encapsulate essential information about the ad offers, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of each offer's nuances and requirements.

| Key                       | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `creator.name`            | The name of the creator or entity offering the ad space.|
| `creator.description`     | A brief description of the creator or entity.|
| `creator.image`           | A URL to an image of the creator or entity's logo.|
| `creator.external_link`   | A link to the creator's external website.|
| `creator.categories`      | Categories describing the creator or entity's industry or focus areas.|
| `offer.name`              | The name of the ad offer.|
| `offer.description`       | A detailed description of what the ad offer entails, including information about the tokenization of ad spaces and the rights provided to the buyers.|
| `offer.image`             | A URL to an image representing the ad offer.|
| `offer.terms`             | A link to the terms and conditions of the ad offer.|
| `offer.external_link`     | An external link related to the offer, where the ad integration is visible for example.|
| `offer.valid_from`        | The start date from when the ad offer is valid.|
| `offer.valid_to`          | The end date until when the ad offer remains valid.|
| `offer.categories`        | Categories describing the type of exposure or audience the ad offer targets.|
| `offer.token_metadata.name`     | A template name for a tokenized ad space.|
| `offer.token_metadata.description` | A detailed description of a tokenized ad space.|
| `offer.token_metadata.image`    | A URL to a image for a tokenized ad space.|
| `offer.token_metadata.external_url` | An external URL related to a tokenized ad space.|
| `offer.token_metadata.attributes` | Attributes of a tokenized ad space. |

**Note:** All these fields are optionnal

### Descriptions

Descriptions (`description` keys) may:

* include a `\n` to render a breakline
* be in Markdown format

### Images and external Links

Links (`terms`, `external_link` & `image` keys) may be from IPFS, Arweave, or HTTPS protocols.

### Dates

* If `valid_from` is not provided, the default value is `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`
* If `valid_to` is not provided, the default value is `2100-01-01T00:00:00Z`

### Token metadata

`offer.token_metadata` is structured according [the ERC721 metadata standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md). When generating metadata for a specific tokenized ad space, the `{tokenData}` placeholder should be replaced with the `tokenData` value specified on `DSponsorNFT.Mint` event.
